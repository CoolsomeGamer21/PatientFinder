##ðŸ˜ŽInspirationðŸ˜Ž
How many times have you had to create accounts for different apps and websites for your wellbeing such as fitness apps, meditation apps, health apps, doctors apps and more. More and more accounts mean someone could take your data and sell it. That is why I created Patient Finder, your one website for your best overall health.
##ðŸ˜‰What it DoesðŸ˜‰
It is a website where you access medical records from doctors you visited, track your exercise and get paid to exercise as well. You can also meditate with us using teachers who are well experienced in meditation for free. When you schedule appointments you get the best care as possible for an affordable price
